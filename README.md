# A repository of walkthrough projects
This is a collection of mini projects or tasks within online courses which I have worked through. I usually attempt tasks solo, using the walkthrough as a guide when I get stuck. 

This repo contains: 
1. Moma Dataset - learning to clean data via [DataQuest.io](DataQuest.io)
2. Tic Tac Toe - putting functions together as part of [Jose Portilla's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/)

These are a work in progress and will be updated continuously. I am trying to gain maximum exposure and upload regularly as opposed to perfecting each project, so the code may still contain some bugs.
