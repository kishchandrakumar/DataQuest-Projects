# A repository of walkthrough projects
This is a collection of mini projects within online courses which I have worked through to gain understanding of programming concepts. I usually attempt tasks solo for as long as possible, using the walkthroughs as a guide only when I get really stuck. 

#### This repository contains: 
1. App Analysis Project - learning basic data analysis techniques with guided walkthrough from [DataQuest.io](DataQuest.io)
2. Tic Tac Toe - putting functions together as part of [Jose Portilla's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/)
3. Artwork Project - learning to clean the 'Moma' dataset via [DataQuest.io](DataQuest.io)


These are a work in progress and will be updated continuously. Please note that I am aiming to maximise exposure to libraries and projects instead of trying to perfect each project. Therefore you are highly likely to find bugs and/or code that could be optimised. I will always welcome feedback so feel free to give me tips or suggestions for different projects!
